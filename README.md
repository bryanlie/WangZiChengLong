The text in the image is 望子成龍 (wàng zǐ chéng lóng). It is a Chinese idiom that literally translates to "hoping that the son will become a dragon." The idiom is used to describe a parent's hope that their child will grow up to be successful and powerful. It is often used to describe parents who have high expectations for their children and want them to achieve great things.

   
The Chinese idiom 望子成龙 (wàng zǐ chéng lóng) is a common expression that reflects the deep-rooted 
cultural emphasis on parental aspirations for their children's success. There isn't a perfect one-to-one equivalent idiom 
in English that captures the full meaning of 望子成龙. However, there are a few English expressions that come close 
depending on the specific aspect you want to emphasize. For example, if you want to emphasize the parents in such a context, it is close to Tiger Mom. 

A Tiger Mom is a term popularized by author Amy Chua to describe a parenting style characterized by extreme strictness and high expectations,
primarily focused on academic achievement and success. These parents often push their children relentlessly, prioritizing studies over extracurricular activities or social life.
