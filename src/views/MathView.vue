                    <h2>General Math Categories</h2>

                    <h3>Pure Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever wondered about the fundamental patterns hidden in numbers, shapes, and logic? Pure mathematics
                        delves into these, driven by the inherent beauty and structure of math itself. It explores concepts like
                        algebra, geometry, number theory, and topology. While pure math focuses on the elegance of mathematical
                        ideas, its discoveries often have surprising applications later on, like cryptography or computer graphics.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Applied Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Imagine using math to build bridges, predict weather patterns, or create secure online transactions. Applied
                        mathematics equips you with the tools to solve real-world problems across various fields. From optimizing
                        traffic flow to developing new drugs, applied mathematics provides a powerful toolkit for tackling
                        real-world challenges in science, engineering, finance, and more. This category includes probability and
                        statistics, operations research, game theory, and numerical analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Competitive Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Do you thrive on challenges and creative problem-solving? Competitive mathematics is an exciting arena where
                        you race against the clock and others to find clever solutions. Competitive math emphasizes problem-solving
                        speed, creative approaches, and the thrill of competition. While the focus is on winning, competitive math
                        hones your problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking - valuable assets not just for math
                        competitions, but for various academic and professional pursuits.
