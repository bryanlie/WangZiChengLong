                    <h2>Major Categories of Computer Science</h2>

                    <p>Ever wondered how the digital world around you functions? 
                        The answer lies in the fascinating realm of computer science. This vast field encompasses a 
                        variety of interconnected areas, all working together to design, develop, and utilize powerful computing systems.
                         Here are some of the foundational areas that make this possible:</p>

                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This field focuses on creating intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, 
                        and act autonomously. AI research has led to remarkable advancements in areas like machine learning, 
                        computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.  Think of AI as building intelligent machines 
                        that can assist us in various tasks, from recognizing faces to powering virtual assistants.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>
                        This branch deals with the entire software creation process, from the initial spark of an idea to the final 
                        polished product. Software engineers apply engineering principles to create reliable, efficient, maintainable, 
                        and scalable software systems.  Imagine building a bridge - software engineering involves similar planning, 
                        construction, and maintenance, but for the digital world!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the heart of computer science lies the concept of algorithms, which are step-by-step instructions for 
                        solving a problem. Think of them as recipes for computers! Data structures are specialized formats for 
                        organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data efficiently. This area explores various algorithms 
                        and data structures suitable for different computing tasks, ensuring computers can handle information effectively.
