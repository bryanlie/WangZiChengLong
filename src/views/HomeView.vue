                The text in the image is 望子成龍 (wàng zǐ chéng lóng). This is a Chinese idiom that reflects the deep-rooted cultural emphasis on parental aspirations for their children's success. The idiom is often used to describe a parent's hope that their child will grow up to be successful and powerful. In a sense, it is similar to the Western concept of "Tiger Mom/Dad", which describes parents who have high expectations for their children and want them to achieve great things.
